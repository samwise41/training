🚀 The New Projection: 280 - 285 Watts
(If you hit this at your current weight, you will be pushing 3.5+ W/kg. That is serious speed.)
Here is how the year breaks down with this new reality:
1. The "Extended Build" Surge (March – June 20)
• The Opportunity: By extending Phase 2 to June 20th, we have 4 solid months of Threshold and Sweet Spot work.
• The Target: We are looking to add another 10-15 Watts here.
• Checkpoint (Jordanelle Tri): You should enter this race with an FTP of ~270-275W.
2. The "Century" Plateau (July – August 15)
• The Reality: Volume kills intensity. As we ramp up to 4-5 hour rides for the Century, your raw FTP numbers will likely stabilize.
• The Win: We stop trying to raise the ceiling (Max 60 min power) and start raising the floor (power you can hold for 4 hours).
• Projected FTP: Holding steady at 275W, but your endurance at that power will skyrocket.
3. The "Fall Fury" (October – December)
• The Strategy: After Brineman 70.3, we will likely do a focused VO2 Max Block. Your current VO2 Max is 53 (On Target), but your Anaerobic Impact is Low (1.16).
• The Goal: We unlock the final 10-15 Watts by raising your VO2 ceiling in the off-season.
• EOY Target: 285 Watts.
